# Contributing to Veridity RO-Crate-ETH

Welcome to the proof verification infrastructure revolution! This guide helps you contribute to transforming universities into truth verification centers.

## How to Contribute

### Documentation Improvements
- **Proof system frameworks** - enhance universal verification methodologies
- **University guides** - improve deployment instructions for institutions
- **Technical specifications** - refine Ethereum integration patterns
- **Legal frameworks** - strengthen patent compliance documentation

### Implementation Specifications
- **ENS patterns** - develop institutional identity standards
- **EAS schemas** - create attestation frameworks for expert validation
- **IPFS storage** - optimize content addressing for proof verification
- **Low-code integration** - enhance n8n/NocoDB/PostgreSQL workflows

### University Partnership Support
- **Institutional templates** - create reusable deployment frameworks
- **Cost analysis** - document economic models and ROI calculations
- **Best practices** - develop guidelines for verification center operations
- **Training materials** - create educational resources for university staff

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Make improvements** following existing documentation patterns
3. **Test your changes** to ensure clarity and accuracy
4. **Submit a pull request** with clear description of improvements
5. **Engage in review** process for collaborative enhancement

## Code of Conduct

- **Respect institutional requirements** - understand conservative adoption needs
- **Focus on public goods** - prioritize open-source infrastructure development
- **Support truth verification** - advance systematic frameworks for expert validation
- **Enable university transformation** - help institutions discover essential purpose

## Getting Started

Review the [Universal Proof Framework](docs/proof-systems/universal-framework.md) to understand our approach, then explore [University Deployment Guides](university-centers/deployment-guide/) to see implementation strategies.

**Together, we're building public infrastructure for systematic truth verification.**
