# Proof Verification Examples

## The Universal Pattern

Every breakthrough research needs systematic expert validation. Our proof framework provides the structure:

- **forWhom**: WHO needs this breakthrough to be true?
- **claim**: WHAT impossible thing does this achieve?  
- **validators**: WHO can verify this independently?
- **method**: HOW can they test/validate claims?
- **impossiblePromise**: WHAT outcome validates the breakthrough?
