# Veridity System Architecture

## The Truth Verification Crisis

Academic research lacks systematic frameworks for expert validation of breakthrough claims before public disclosure. This forces the impossible choice between career advancement (publication) and commercial protection (patents).

## Our Solution: Proof Verification Infrastructure

### Core Components

**Proof Boxes**: Structured metadata identifying WHO can verify research, WHAT must be confirmed, HOW validation occurs, and WHAT outcomes prove success.

**University Verification Centers**: Trusted physical spaces where experts can examine breakthrough innovations without compromising patent protection.

**A&R Expert Networks**: Professional validation programs where domain specialists are compensated for discovering breakthrough research.

### Technology Integration

**ENS (Identity)**: Institutional hierarchy and persistent researcher identity
**IPFS (Storage)**: Content-addressed proof storage with integrity guarantees  
**EAS (Attestation)**: Verification records and expert reputation building

**Low-code Integration**: n8n/NocoDB/PostgreSQL tools familiar to university IT departments.

## The Transformation

**Before**: Researchers forfeit £1M+ patent value for academic career advancement
**After**: ~£2,000 enables both expert validation and patent protection

Universities evolve from obsolete information providers to essential truth verification infrastructure.
