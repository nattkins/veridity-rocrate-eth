# Universal Proof Framework

## The Breakthrough Insight

The strongest proof systems in human history don't hide evidenceâ€”they multiply validators and make verification methods reproducible.

## The Five Essential Elements

### 1. forWhom
**WHO needs this breakthrough to be true?**
- Identifies the stakeholders who depend on the innovation
- Creates urgency and relevance for validation
- Establishes who benefits from proof

### 2. claim  
**WHAT impossible thing does this achieve?**
- States the breakthrough clearly and boldly
- Identifies what was previously thought impossible
- Creates measurable success criteria

### 3. validators
**WHO can verify this independently?**
- Names specific experts capable of validation
- Provides multiple independent perspectives  
- Enables corroborating testimony

### 4. method
**HOW can they test/validate claims?**
- Describes reproducible verification process
- Enables independent confirmation
- Creates transparent validation pathway

### 5. impossiblePromise
**WHAT transformational outcomes prove success?**
- Identifies results that validate the breakthrough
- Creates measurable impact criteria
- Demonstrates real-world significance

## Application to Research

Every RO-Crate should contain a proof box identifying its verification framework. This transforms research from assertions into systematic truth verification.

**The test**: If someone can't understand your breakthrough and why it matters from these elements, you're either describing it wrong or it's not for them.
